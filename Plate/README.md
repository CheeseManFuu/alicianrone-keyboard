Full Alicianrone plate, intended for traditional MX-footprint switches and PCB mount stabilizers.

Plate should be made at 1.5mm thickness at minimum. Results when made thicker are not guaranteed.

All 90Â° corners are filleted at 0.25mm.

Plate does not need threading or countersink.

Top-mount holes are 1.75mm to accommodate an M2 screw.

Removal of top mount *or* gasket tabs should not cause failure for the other mount. Obviously don't remove both of them, dummy.

Hole in between Pipe and Right Bracket is meant to allow access to the reset switch. Filling in this hole is not recommended.
