# Alicianrone Keyboard
This is the respository for CheeseManFuu's keyboard, currently dubbed Alicianrone.

The Alicianrone was initially sparked by the acquisition of [GMK Arch](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=112566.0) btw, something of a morbid joke of continuing on the spirit of "making your own thing that works the best and is the most modular even if it's jank." Over the course of 2 and a half years the Alicianrone has gone through 6 revisions until finally getting to a producable state that it's currently in.

After the plans of finishing a run or two of Alicianrone, releasing the full source of the Alicianrone (current and previous) will be uploaded as a *full open-source project* for the sake of preservation, derivative work, documentation, and the like. Until then, this repository will hold a couple things: The plate DXF file, the brass weight model in a couple of filetypes for your favorite manufacturer, and of course the firmware source code and compiled JSON.
