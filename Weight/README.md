Full Alicianrone internal/external Brass weight.

Recommended to use H59 Brass, T3 Copper, or 303SE Stainless Steel, or similar.

Multiple filetypes available for different manufacturers. When OBJ is requested, check if MTL file is needed for material reference. MTL file is not used for any other filetype.

Weight includes threads, so technical drawing is provided as a PDF. Countersinking is not needed. Recommended to provide the QC Doc to ensure you get a viable end product.

If you don't know what type of finish to do, do a beadblast/sandblast with a granularity of 150 grit or finer with a clear coat.

Can also use Aluminum if paired with a plastic case. Ideally should be Aluminum 6063 (or 7075 if you want to be ballsy) anodized in your prefered color. The provided QC Doc should still cover this.

Do what you will with these prices, but I cannot guarantee that they will be accurate to a determination done by an engineer.
